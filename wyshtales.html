<p>As of right now, Wyshtales can only be canine dragons. <br> Bear with me, its a bit complex. Wyshtales are designed to have a plush form with stricter design rules and colors. they are meant to be able to easily translate into real plushies, with visible stitches as part of their design. <br> Their virtual forms still have limited colors, but their patterns and designs are not regulated. There are even some traits specific to the virtual form! <br> Wyshtales get black and white as free colors in their fleece color pool. They also get one additional color of your choice. However, provide proof of a fleece fabric that matches your choice, and you can have a patterned fleece as your main color. They get one fur color to start, and one star color. <br>The center seam is required</p>

<p>Tiny mistake on star color here. One color is base; two colors is Special!</p>
<p>Wyshtales have five trait categories: Base, Uncommon, Rare, Special, and Unique. <br> All Wyshtales are created with Base traits; that's why we call them Base! 
<br> Wyshtales gain traits by leveling up. Mechanically, this means every piece of art you've collected of your Wyshtale counts as a level, if the art is at least a clean, colored headshot sketch (we recommend separating viable art and non viable art into sub galleries. Every fifth level, the Wyshtale gains an Uncommon trait, at levels 20, 40, 60, and 80, you will gain up to a Rare trait instead. At level 50, you gain a Special trait. At level 100, you will gain a color, a Special trait, or an Illegal trait. Special traits are also available through purchase at shops, on special occasions. <br> Unique traits are individual traits that are not on the sheets. These will often be adopts. </p>
<h1>Accents</h1>
<p>Accents are small details that should be noted on your design sheets. These draw attention to details you don't want missed. If you want an accent in a color you don't have on your wyshtale, you may add it as a rare trait.</p>

<h1>Wyshtales are prone to many other unique traits as well!</h1>
<p>Uncommon</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Cotton Stars: Allows Wyshtale's star fabric to be a cotton/flannel fabric </li>
     <li>Bigger wings: Wings can be up to 50% of the body size </li>
     <li>Felt wings: Wings are made of layered felt, this gives the look of feathers. 
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Rare</p>
<ul>
  <li>
   Starspill: One of Wyshtale's Star Spots 'spills.' This is similar to stardust parts in other species. </li>
   <li> Star parts: Converts up to 33% of Wyshtale's non-Star fabric into Star fabric.
